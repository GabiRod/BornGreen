            <p>
                The Earth’s climate has changed throughout history. The planet’s average surface temperature has risen about 0.9 degrees since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere. Most of the warming occurred in the past 35 years, with the five warmest years on record taking place since 2010.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Denmark, CO2 emissions have decreased by 26% since 1990. However, recent studies show that if new and creative measures are not taken, emissions will increase from 2020. If we don’t take action, climate change will cause average global temperatures to increase more than 3°C, and will adversely affect every ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>
                In BornGreen we take the opportunity to take action that will lead to generating jobs, prosperity, and better lives for future generations while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and building climate resilience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every other tree planted helps to protect the environment, contributing to the biodiversity and the ecosystem. A single oak tree absorbs one ton of carbon dioxide by the time it gets 40 years old.
            </p>
            <p>
                BornGreen goes a step further and invests in making the future generations more familiar with nature, educating them in becoming sustainable individuals.
